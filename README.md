# WIP

Uses [simpleMenuWizard](https://github.com/stonecrusher/simpleMenuWizard). Takes some code from [DuskFox](https://github.com/aminomancer/uc.css.js).

## Installation

1. Place `chrome` inside your profile folder.
2. Also place `user.js` inside your profile folder. Make sure it's _not_ inside `chrome`.

## Configuration

Configuration is located in `_config.css`.

`userContent.css` is generated from the files in `src`. This customizes things like the `about:` pages and isn't required for the theme.
